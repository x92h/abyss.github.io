        <p>When a command is invoked, we store the message content for a maximum of 14 days for debugging purposes. We also store a maximum of 18 entries for edited messages and sniping messages that will expire in two hours or less in volatile memory.</p><br/><br/>

                Nickname, Username and Avatar changes are logged in order for the "namehistory" and "avatarhistory" commands to function. Users can clear this data themselves at any time.<br/>
                Guild name changes are logged in order for the "gnames" command to function. Server administrators can clear this data themselves at any time.</p>
